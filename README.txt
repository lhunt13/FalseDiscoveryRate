METHODS:
The app computes the science wise false discovery rates (swfdr) and local false discovery rate (lfdr) (i.e., posterior p-values) values by applying the method discussed here:

USE OF APP:
Select the journals and years for which you want to calculate the swfsr and lfdr. The app computes the swfdr within each journal both across selected years and within each year. It computes lfdr values by applying the model within each journal and across all selected years. 

The Summary tab reports the swfdr values.

The Time Trend tab shows trends in swfdr values over time.

The Histogram tab plots histograms of the p-values and corresponding lfdr values for each journal (across selected years).

The Dataset tab lists the individual p-values (along with journal, pubmed ID, etcâ€¦) used to fit the model.
